## Lesson Recap: Exploring the Web & Setting Up Your Development Environment

### Exploring the Web: Behind the Scenes of Your Browser
- **How the Web Works:** The internet operates on a client-server model, where the browser (client) requests data from servers. Servers respond with the requested information, such as web pages.
- **Key Terminology:**
  - **Client/Server:** The browser sends requests; the server provides responses.
  - **TCP/IP:** Protocols that ensure data is transferred reliably across the network.
  - **DNS:** Converts human-readable domain names into IP addresses.
  - **HTTP/HTTPS:** The language used for communication between client and server.
- **The HTTP Request-Response Cycle:**
  1. The browser (client) sends a request to the server.
  2. The server processes the request and sends back a response.
  3. The browser renders the content (HTML, CSS, JS) based on the response.

### Setting Up Your Development Environment: Code Editor and Browser
- **Code Editors:**
  - **VS Code:** Preferred editor for its powerful features, like integrated terminal, extensions, and built-in Git support. 
  - **Sublime Text:** A lightweight, fast alternative for basic coding needs.
- **Browser:**
  - **Chrome:** The preferred browser for development, thanks to its developer tools that help inspect elements, debug code, and monitor network activity.
  - **Other Options:** Testing in **Firefox** and **Safari** ensures compatibility across different platforms.

### Key Takeaways:
- The Web relies on protocols and systems like TCP/IP, DNS, and HTTP to deliver and display web pages.
- Installing a flexible code editor like **VS Code** and using **Chrome's DevTools** will enhance your coding and debugging experience.
- Testing across multiple browsers ensures that web projects are functional and accessible to a wider audience.
