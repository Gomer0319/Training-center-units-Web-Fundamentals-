### Introduction: Adding Style to Your Web Pages

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the design language used to add style and layout to web pages. With CSS, you can transform plain HTML into visually engaging content by adjusting colors, fonts, and much more. Basic CSS styling is the foundation for building visually appealing websites.

### Essential CSS Styling Properties

#### 1. **Text Styling**
Text is one of the most common elements you'll style. You can modify its appearance using CSS properties like `color`, `font-size`, and `text-align`.

- **Example:**
  ```css
  h1 {
      color: navy;
      font-size: 32px;
      text-align: center;
  }
  ```
  This styles all `<h1>` headings with a navy color, larger font size, and centered alignment.

#### 2. **Backgrounds**
CSS allows you to change the background color or add images to elements, enhancing visual appeal and providing structure to web pages.

- **Example:**
  ```css
  body {
      background-color: #f0f0f0;
  }
  ```
  This adds a light gray background to the entire webpage.

- You can also use an image as a background:
  ```css
  .hero {
      background-image: url('hero-background.jpg');
      background-size: cover;
  }
  ```

#### 3. **Borders**
Borders can be added around any HTML element to give structure or highlight specific sections. You can define the borderâ€™s width, style, and color.

- **Example:**
  ```css
  p {
      border: 2px solid black;
      padding: 10px;
  }
  ```
  This adds a solid black border around all paragraphs and provides some internal spacing with padding.
