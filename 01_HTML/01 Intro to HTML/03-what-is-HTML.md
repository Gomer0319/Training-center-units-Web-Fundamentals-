## What is HTML? 

### Developmental Outcomes
By the end of this lesson, students should be able to:
1. Define HTML and its purpose in web development.
2. Understand the basic structure of an HTML document.
3. Recognize the significance of HTML in web development.

### Building Blocks of the Web
Imagine building a house. Just like you need bricks and wood to construct the walls, you need HTML (HyperText Markup Language) to create the structure of a webpage. HTML provides the foundation for web content, allowing browsers to understand and display text, images, links, and other elements.

### What is HTML?
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard language used to create and design documents on the web. Here are some key points about HTML:
   - Markup Language: HTML uses "tags" to mark up text, images, and other content so that browsers can render them correctly.
   - Structure: It defines the structure of a webpage, indicating which parts are headings, paragraphs, links, images, etc.
   - Links: The "HyperText" part means you can create links between different pages, allowing users to navigate the web easily.

### Basic Structure of an HTML Document
An HTML document has a specific structure that includes essential elements:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
    <a href="https://www.example.com">Click here to visit Example</a>
</body>
</html>
```

   - `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares the document type and version of HTML.
   - `<html>`: The root element that contains all the content.
   - `<head>`: Contains metadata, including the title of the webpage.
   - `<title>`: Sets the title of the webpage (shown in the browser tab).
   - `<body>`: Contains the visible content of the webpage, like headings, paragraphs, and links.


### Why HTML Matters
HTML is essential for web development because:
   - It provides the basic structure for webpages.
   - It allows for easy linking and navigation between pages.
   - It is the foundation for other web technologies, such as CSS (for styling) and JavaScript (for interactivity).

### Key Points
- HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the language used to create webpages.
- It structures content with tags and elements, allowing browsers to display information correctly.
- Understanding HTML is crucial for anyone interested in web development, as it forms the foundation for building and designing websites.
