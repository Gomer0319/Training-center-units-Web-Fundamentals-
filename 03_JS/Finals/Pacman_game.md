## Create Your Own Pacman-Like Game

### Trainee Goal
By completing this assignment, trainees will:
1. Apply their knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functional game.
2. Implement game elements such as character movement, obstacles, and basic game mechanics.
3. Enhance problem-solving skills through research on game features like obstacle placement and collision detection.

### Duration
8 hours

### Difficulty
Advanced

### Instructions
Create a Pacman-like game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game should include the following features:

1. **Game Setup**:
   - Create a simple game area where a "Pacman-like" character can move around.
   - Include at least three "ghost-like" enemies moving within the game area.
   
2. **Character Movement**:
   - Implement movement controls (using arrow keys or WASD) for your main character.
   
3. **Obstacle Placement and Collision**:
   - Include walls or obstacles that the main character and enemies must navigate around.
   - Implement collision detection to prevent the character from passing through walls.

4. **Enemy Movement**:
   - The enemies should move in a predetermined or random pattern within the game area.

5. **Design and Creativity**:
   - Use assets for the main character, enemies, and obstacles. Trainees must find their own assets online.
   - Add creative touches to make the game unique in appearance and style.

6. **Submission**:
   - Compress your project folder (HTML, CSS, JS, and assets) and rename it to `first_last_pacman.zip`.
   - Submit the zip file for evaluation.

### Bonus Task
For extra points:
- Implement a feature where the enemies chase the main character when in close proximity.
- Add movement animations for the main character and the enemies.
- Introduce power-ups that give the main character temporary advantages (e.g., speed boost, enemy freeze).
- Implement a score-tracking system to keep track of points collected during the game.

### Criteria for Success
Evaluation will be based on:
- Proper application of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Implementation of character movement and collision detection.
- Creativity in designing the game and sourcing appropriate assets.
- **Bonus**: Successfully implementing the enemy chase feature, animations, power-ups, and score-tracking.
