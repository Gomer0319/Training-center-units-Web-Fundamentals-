## Request-Response Cycle

### Developmental Outcomes
By the end of this lesson, students should be able to:
1. Understand the basic flow of the Request-Response Cycle.
2. Learn about HTTP methods, status codes, and headers.
3. Grasp why the Request-Response Cycle is important for web communication.

### How Browsers and Servers Talk
The Request-Response Cycle is how your browser (client) talks to a web server to get information, like when you visit a webpage. The browser asks for something (request), and the server sends it back (response).

### Steps of the Request-Response Cycle

1. Browser Makes a Request

    Your browser sends a message to the server asking for a resource (like a webpage).
    The request includes:

   - HTTP Method: What you want to do (e.g., **GET** for fetching data).
   - URL: The address of the resource.
   - Headers: Extra information, like the browser type.
  
2. Server Receives the Request

    The server reads the request and finds the requested resource.

3. Server Sends a Response

    The server sends back:

   - Status Code: Tells if the request was successful (e.g., 200 OK) or if there was an error (e.g., 404 Not Found).
   - Headers: Info about the response, like content type (HTML, JSON, etc.).
   - Body: The actual content (e.g., HTML for the webpage).

4. Browser Shows the Response

    The browser takes the response from the server and displays it.


### Key Components
HTTP Methods: Define actions like GET (to get data) or POST (to send data).
Status Codes: Indicate whether the request was successful (200) or not (404).
Headers: Provide additional information about the request and response.

### Why It Matters
The Request-Response Cycle is how your browser and web servers communicate, making it possible to load webpages, submit forms, and interact with websites.

### Key Points
- The browser sends a request, and the server sends a response.
- HTTP methods, status codes, and headers are important parts of the cycle.
- This cycle powers all your interactions on the web.
