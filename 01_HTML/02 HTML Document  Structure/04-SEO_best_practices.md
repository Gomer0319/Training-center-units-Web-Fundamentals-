### Introduction: The Road to Visibility

SEO is essential for making your website discoverable by users. Properly structuring your HTML is a critical component of SEO because it helps search engines understand your content. In this lesson, we will explore HTML best practices that enhance your site's SEO performance.

### Key HTML Elements for SEO

#### 1. **Title Tag (`<title>`)**
- The title tag is one of the most important SEO elements. It defines the title of the webpage, appearing in search engine results and browser tabs.
- **Best Practice**: Keep it under 60 characters and include relevant keywords.

  **Example:**
  ```html
  <title>Learn HTML Basics - My Website</title>
  ```

#### 2. **Meta Description (`<meta>` tag)**
- The meta description provides a brief summary of the page content. It appears under the title in search results.
- **Best Practice**: Write a compelling description (around 150-160 characters) that includes keywords.

  **Example:**
  ```html
  <meta name="description" content="Learn the basics of HTML in this comprehensive guide. Perfect for beginners and aspiring web developers.">
  ```

#### 3. **Header Tags (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`)**
- Header tags structure your content and emphasize its hierarchy. The `<h1>` tag should be unique and represent the main topic of the page, while `<h2>` and `<h3>` tags are used for subheadings.
- **Best Practice**: Use only one `<h1>` tag per page and include relevant keywords.

  **Example:**
  ```html
  <h1>Introduction to HTML</h1>
  <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
  ```

#### 4. **Image Alt Attributes (`alt`)**
- The `alt` attribute provides a text description of images. This helps search engines understand the content of the image and improves accessibility for visually impaired users.
- **Best Practice**: Use descriptive and relevant alt text that includes keywords where appropriate.

  **Example:**
  ```html
  <img src="html-guide.jpg" alt="HTML Guide for Beginners">
  ```

#### 5. **Proper Indentation and Nesting**
- Maintaining proper indentation and nesting in HTML improves readability and helps you and others understand the structure of your document more easily. This practice also aids in debugging and ensures that the browser renders the content correctly.
  
  **Best Practice**: Indent nested elements for clarity.

  **Example:**
  ```html
  <div>
      <h2>Section Title</h2>
      <p>This is a paragraph in the section.</p>
      <ul>
          <li>List Item 1</li>
          <li>List Item 2</li>
      </ul>
  </div>
  ```

### Things to Avoid in HTML for SEO

1. **Using Multiple `<h1>` Tags**: Having more than one `<h1>` tag can confuse search engines about the main topic of your page.
  
   **Example to Avoid**:
   ```html
   <h1>Main Title</h1>
   <h1>Another Title</h1>
   ```

2. **Keyword Stuffing**: Overusing keywords in your content, title tags, and meta descriptions can harm your SEO rankings. Aim for natural, readable text.

3. **Neglecting Accessibility**: Failing to use `alt` attributes for images can limit accessibility and reduce your SEO effectiveness.

   **Example to Avoid**:
   ```html
   <img src="image.jpg"> <!-- Missing alt attribute -->
   ```

4. **Lack of Semantic HTML**: Not using semantic elements makes it harder for search engines to interpret your content structure. Always prefer semantic tags when applicable.

5. **Improper HTML Structure**: Avoid mixing block-level and inline elements improperly, which can lead to rendering issues.

   **Example to Avoid**:
   ```html
   <p>This is a paragraph <h2>Incorrectly Nested Heading</h2></p>
   ```
