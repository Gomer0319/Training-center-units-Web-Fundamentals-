Competency Map:





Content:
I'm creating a competency map for the HTML unit of a HTML course. Create a list of learning outcomes for the topic I will provide. It should always start with a verb but do not use the words Understand and Use. Do not add adjectives such as effectively or efficiently or add a reason why the learning outcomes are important. Make the sentence short. The maximum number of the learning outcomes should be 3. |
