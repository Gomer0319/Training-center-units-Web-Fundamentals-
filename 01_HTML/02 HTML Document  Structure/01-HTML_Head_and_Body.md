## HTML Head and Body

### Developmental Outcomes
By the end of this lesson, students should be able to:
1. Identify the purpose of the `<head>` and `<body>` sections in an HTML document.
2. Understand the key elements commonly found in the `<head>` section.
3. Recognize how content in the `<body>` section is displayed on the webpage.

### Introduction: The Blueprint of a Webpage

When constructing a house, you have blueprints that outline the structure and layout. In HTML, the `<head>` and `<body>` elements serve a similar purpose. The `<head>` section provides important information about the webpage, while the `<body>` section contains the actual content that users see.


### The `<head>` Section

The `<head>` section of an HTML document contains metadata and information about the webpage that isnâ€™t displayed directly on the page. It plays a crucial role in how browsers interpret and present the content.

#### Key Elements in the `<head>` Section:
- **Title (`<title>`)**: Sets the title of the webpage, displayed on the browser tab.
- **Meta Tags (`<meta>`)**: Provide information about the page, such as character set, description, and keywords for search engines.
- **Link to Stylesheets (`<link>`)**: Connects external CSS files for styling the webpage.
- **Scripts (`<script>`)**: Links to JavaScript files for interactivity.

**Example of a `<head>` section:**
```html
<head>
    <title>My Webpage</title>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="description" content="A simple webpage example.">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</head>
```

### The `<body>` Section

The `<body>` section contains all the visible content of the webpage. This is where you place text, images, links, and other elements that users interact with.

#### Key Points About the `<body>` Section:
- It is displayed in the browser window and contains all the elements that users see and interact with.
- You can use various HTML elements to format and organize content, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and links.

**Example of a `<body>` section:**
```html
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph about my website.</p>
    <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>
</body>
```

### Why the Head and Body Matter

- The `<head>` section helps search engines and browsers understand your webpage's purpose and style, affecting SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and user experience.
- The `<body>` section is where the actual content is displayed, making it crucial for engaging users and delivering information.
