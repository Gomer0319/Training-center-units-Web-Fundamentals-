## JavaScript Basics: Variables, Data Types, and Operators

### Trainee Goal
1. Practice declaring and logging variables using `var`, `let`, and `const`.
2. Identify and work with different data types using `typeof`.
3. Manipulate arrays, create objects, and apply operators for simple calculations.

### Instructions

1. In this task, youâ€™ll work on a series of JavaScript challenges to reinforce your understanding of variable declaration, data types, arrays, objects, and operators. Please save your work in a Markdown (.md) file in VS Code. Complete the following challenges:

#### Challenge 1: Variable Declaration
- Declare a `var` variable named `city` and assign it `"New York"`.
- Declare a `let` variable named `age` and assign it `30`.
- Declare a `const` variable named `birthYear` and assign it `1995`.
- Log the values of all three variables to the console.

#### Challenge 2: Working with Data Types
- Declare a variable `greeting` with the value `"Good Morning!"`.
- Declare a variable `price` with the value `19.99`.
- Declare a variable `isLoggedIn` with the value `true`.
- Declare a variable `user` with the value `null`.
- Declare a variable `productName` with no value.
- Use `console.log` to print the type of each variable using `typeof`.

### Challenge 3: Manipulating Arrays
- Create an array `colors` with `"red"`, `"green"`, and `"blue"`.
- Access the second item in the array and log it to the console.
- Add a new color `"yellow"` to the end of the array.
- Log the length of the array to the console.

### Challenge 4: Creating an Object
- Declare an object `car` with the properties: `brand: "Toyota"`, `model: "Corolla"`, and `year: 2018`.
- Log the `brand` and `year` to the console.
- Add a new property `color` with the value `"red"`.
- Log the updated object.

### Challenge 5: Arithmetic Operators
- Declare two variables `a = 10` and `b = 3`.
- Log the result of the following:
  - Sum of `a + b`
  - Difference of `a - b`
  - Product of `a * b`
  - Result of `a / b`
  - Remainder when `a` is divided by `b`

### Challenge 6: Comparison Operators
- Declare two variables `x = 5` and `y = "5"`.
- Use comparison operators to check:
  - `x == y`
  - `x === y`
  - `x != y`
  - `x > y` and `x < y`
- Log the results.

### Challenge 7: Logical Operators
- Declare a variable `isMember = true` and `hasDiscount = false`.
- Use logical operators to check:
  - Whether the user is a member **and** has a discount.
  - Whether the user is a member **or** has a discount.
  - Negate the value of `isMember` and log it.

### Challenge 8: Modifying Variables with Assignment Operators
- Declare a variable `score = 50`.
- Use the `+=` operator to add `10` to `score`.
- Use the `-=` operator to subtract `5`.
- Use the `*=` operator to multiply `score` by `2`.
- Use the `/=` operator to divide the score by `3`.
- Log the final `score`.

### Challenge 9: Mixing Data Types
- Declare an object `person` with properties `name: "John"`, `age: 25`, `isStudent: true`.
- Add an array `courses` with `"Math"`, `"Science"`, `"History"`.
- Log the `name` and the first course from `person.courses`.

### Challenge 10: String and Number Conversion
- Declare a string `strNum = "100"`, convert it to a number, and add `50`. Log the result.
- Declare a number `num = 200`, convert it to a string, and concatenate `" dollars"`. Log the result.

2. Submission: Once completed, save your file as `first_last_challenges.md`. Compress this file into a `.zip` folder and rename it to `first_last_challenges.zip` before submitting.

### Bonus Task:  
Experiment with other ways of converting between data types, such as using `parseInt`, `parseFloat`, or `toString`. Try these on a few of your existing variables to deepen your understanding.

### Criteria for Success
- All variables are declared and logged correctly in each challenge.
- Appropriate data types are identified using `typeof`.
- Arrays and objects are manipulated as instructed, and the correct outputs are logged.
- Arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators are used correctly, and results are logged.
- Submission meets the format requirements and includes correct answers for all challenges.
