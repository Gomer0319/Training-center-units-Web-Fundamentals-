## Setting Up Your Development Environment: Code Editor and Browser

### Developmental Outcome
By the end of this lesson, learners will:
1. Install and configure a code editor (VS Code or Sublime Text) to start writing code.
2. Understand the role of a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) in web development.
3. Set up their development environment for efficient coding and testing.

### Building Your Toolkit: The Hammer and the Lens
Think of web development tools like a craftsman’s kit. Your **code editor** is the hammer—you’ll use it to build and shape your code. Your **browser** is the lens through which you’ll view and test your creations. Both are essential to your success as a developer.

### Setting Up Your Code Editor: VS Code (Primary Tool)

#### Why VS Code?
Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a popular, free, and lightweight code editor. It’s highly customizable and offers features that make writing, debugging, and managing your code easier.

**Steps to Install VS Code:**
1. Go to the [VS Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Download the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
3. Follow the installation prompts to complete the setup.
4. Once installed, launch VS Code and familiarize yourself with the layout (e.g., Explorer, Terminal, Extensions).

**Key Features of VS Code:**
- **Integrated Terminal:** Run commands directly within the editor.
- **Extensions Marketplace:** Install extensions like Prettier (for formatting), Live Server (for previewing HTML), and others to improve your workflow.
- **Built-in Git:** Manage your code versioning without leaving the editor.

#### Sublime Text as an Alternative
If you prefer a simpler or lighter code editor, **Sublime Text** is a great alternative. It’s fast and responsive, with basic features that cater to both beginners and advanced developers.
- **Steps to Install Sublime Text:** Visit [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), download the appropriate version, and follow similar steps to VS Code for installation.

### Setting Up Your Web Browser: Chrome (Preferred)

#### Why Chrome?
Google Chrome is the preferred browser for web development due to its powerful developer tools, performance, and frequent updates. It helps you inspect and debug web pages efficiently.

**Steps to Install Chrome:**
1. Visit the [Google Chrome website](https://www.google.com/chrome/).
2. Download the appropriate version for your operating system.
3. Install and launch Chrome.

**Using Chrome for Development:**
- **Developer Tools:** Press `F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I` (Windows) / `Cmd + Option + I` (Mac) to access Chrome’s DevTools.
  - **Elements:** Inspect and edit HTML and CSS in real-time.
  - **Console:** Debug JavaScript and log errors.
  - **Network:** Monitor HTTP requests and load times.

#### Other Browser Options for Reference
- **Firefox:** Known for its robust developer tools and privacy-focused features.
- **Safari (macOS):** Default browser for Mac users, with good developer support.

While Chrome is the go-to for most developers, it’s helpful to test your web projects in different browsers to ensure compatibility.

### Key Points
- **VS Code** is the preferred code editor for its flexibility, integrated tools, and extensions.
- **Sublime Text** serves as a lightweight alternative for basic code editing needs.
- **Chrome** is the primary browser for development due to its powerful developer tools, though testing across **Firefox** and **Safari** ensures cross-browser compatibility.
