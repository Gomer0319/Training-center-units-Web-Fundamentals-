## Mastering CSS Specificity: Prioritizing Your Styles

### Developmental Outcomes
By the end of this lesson, students should be able to:
1. Understand what CSS specificity is and why it matters in styling.
2. Identify how different selectors contribute to specificity values.
3. Apply knowledge of specificity to resolve conflicts in their stylesheets effectively.

### Demystifying CSS Specificity

CSS specificity determines which styles are applied to an element when there are conflicting rules. It acts like a ranking system, assigning point values to different types of selectors. Understanding specificity helps you write more predictable and maintainable CSS.

### The Point System for Specificity

CSS specificity is calculated using a point system based on the types of selectors used. The values are assigned as follows:

- **Inline Styles**: 
  - **Points**: 1000
  - **Example**: `style="color: red;"`
  
- **IDs**: 
  - **Points**: 100
  - **Example**: `#header`
  
- **Classes, Attributes, and Pseudo-classes**: 
  - **Points**: 10
  - **Example**: `.nav`, `[type="text"]`, `:hover`
  
- **Elements and Pseudo-elements**: 
  - **Points**: 1
  - **Example**: `h1`, `p`, `::before`

### How Specificity is Calculated

To determine the overall specificity of a selector, you sum the points based on the selectors it contains. For example:

- **Inline Style**: `style="color: red;"` → **1000 points**
- **ID Selector**: `#header` → **100 points**
- **Class Selector**: `.nav` → **10 points**
- **Element Selector**: `h1` → **1 point**

### Example Calculation

Consider the following CSS rules:

```css
h1 {
    color: blue;
}

#header {
    color: green;
}

.nav {
    color: orange;
}

div {
    color: purple;
}

<div id="header" class="nav" style="color: red;">Hello</div>
```

- **`h1`**: 1 point
- **`#header`**: 100 points
- **`.nav`**: 10 points
- **Inline Style**: 1000 points

When applied to the `<div>`, the effective style will be **red** due to the highest specificity from the inline style.

### Importance of CSS Specificity

- **Conflict Resolution**: Helps manage and resolve conflicts when multiple styles are applied to the same element.
- **Maintainability**: Promotes better organization in your CSS, making it easier to update and maintain styles over time.
- **Predictability**: Understanding specificity allows you to predict which styles will apply, improving your workflow.

### Key Points
- CSS specificity determines which styles are applied when multiple rules conflict.
- Specificity is calculated using a point system: inline styles (1000 points), IDs (100 points), classes (10 points), and elements (1 point).
- Understanding specificity is crucial for resolving conflicts, maintaining stylesheets, and ensuring predictable styling behavior.
